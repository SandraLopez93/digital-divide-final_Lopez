          <h2>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, children across the region of Latin America have lost nearly 4x more days of schooling compared to children from other regions of the world, according to a recent report by Unicef. </h2>

          <h3> Not all countries within the region, however, were impacted in the same way </h3>

          <p> Nations resorted to a variety of different learning methods. From listening along to radio transmissions and televised programming, to digital applications on computers and phones, efforts to keep students connected was paramount. Given all of these options, how then, were students falling behind at unprecedented rates?

           This report will compare the various learning methods introduced to students in Brazil, the wealthiest, and most digitally connected nation, and Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in the region. </p>
